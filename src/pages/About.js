      <section>
        I'm a DevOps and Linux Enthusiast, as well as an aspiring Data Scientist and Autodidact.
        <br />
        <br />

        Originally from Colorado, I moved to San Francisco in 2006 to attend Culinary School. I worked as a Professional Chef for 11 years. After some introspection, I embarked on a career change into Linux Systems Administration, Back-End Software Development and Data Science.

        I started learning Linux and Python for fun and it quickly became my primary focus. I always had  a passion for Technology. Prior to joining IBM, I spent the two years using multiple resources to learn object-oriented programming using languages like Python, while focusing on the Pandas and Numpy libraries. I use Linux as my primary OS and JavaScript for web development. I spend countless hours studying Computer Science, Data Structures, Algorithms, and Linear Algebra.

        <br />

        I'm always eager to learn something new by keeping up with what's new. I'm constantly researching and using new library modules or new tools. Throughout my learning journey and career, I've greatly improved my problem solving and communication skills. I'm able to work independently and take initiative, as well as work collaboratively and contribute to an agile team environment. I use analytical problem-solving skill to determine work flow and priorities.

        I believe a senior position would be a perfect vehicle for me to reach my next level of expertise.
